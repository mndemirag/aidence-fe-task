## About The App
The app fetches user information from [the API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users") and stores it in localStorage for further manipulation.

After fetching from the API once, editing or deleting a row on the table updates only the localStorage copy to be stored and shown.

Due to the time constraint, the app lacks proper testing.
